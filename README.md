# pangramGenerator
* Pangrams are sentences that contain at least one instance of all 26 letters of the alphabet.

* This is a program that will generate pangrams, It uses llms (Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF running locally)
to accomplish this along with a small amount of post proccessing to ensure it is a valid pangram.

* There is a plan to add options for styles of sentences, such as a whimsical fantasy author or
a new York times editor,

* There will be user input options for a sentence starter, a target number of words or characters,
or words/phrases to include in the pangram.
