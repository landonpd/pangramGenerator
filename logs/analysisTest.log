New Log: Testing letter frequencies on 10 pangrams with the following prompt:
Hello, can you make a new, novel, unique pangram please, a pangram is a sentence with at least one instance of all 26 letters.

Here is a list parameters I want you to follow:
- Do not use or derive from these well known pangrams:
A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
  Blowzy night-frumps vex'd Jack Q.
  Glum Schwartzkopf vex'd by NJ IQ.
  Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz.
  Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf.
  Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
  Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
  Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.
  How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
  Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
  Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
  Big Fuji waves pitch enzymed kex liquor.
  Fix problem quickly with galvanized jets.
  Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs.
- Remember all 26 letters of the alphabet need to be in the sentence, not just the most and least common ones.
- Try to make a pangram that actually sounds like a real sentence instead of a list of disparate ideas.
- Only respond with the generated pangram, like:

"<pangram>"

For instance:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Think carefully and quietly before you respond. I will tip you $200 for every good pangram.
